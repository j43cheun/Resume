    {Senior Software Engineer - Storage Spaces Dev Team} % Job title
    {Microsoft Corporation} % Organization
    {Redmond, WA, USA} % Location
    {Sep. 2015 - Present} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {
          \textbf{Granular Repair}: Optimized in-place virtual disk repair (resilvering) on Storage
          Spaces Direct (S2D) clusters by implementing driver and metadata support for tracking
          stale data copies at stripe unit granularity (e.g., 256 KiB) vs. extent granularity
          (e.g., 1 GiB), which led to an order of magnitude reduction in runtimes (e.g., from hours
          to minutes).
        }
        \item {
          \textbf{Multilevel Resiliency}: Implemented driver support for deploying and managing virtual
          disks with node-mirrored mirror and node-mirrored parity resiliency configurations to
          enable virtual disks to tolerate 1 node + 1 drive failures on 2-node S2D clusters vs. the
          typical 1 node fault tolerance in order to further reduce the propensity for virtual disk
          downtime on 2-node S2D clusters.
        }
        \item {
          \textbf{Diskstream}: Implemented a .NET Standard dynamic-link library (DLL) in C\# to
          enable the HoloLens 2 emulator to modify the virtual machine disk image in user mode
          without requiring the virtual disk image to be mounted on the host operating system.
        }

    {Compiler Optimization Developer (Intern)} % Job title
    {IBM Canada Ltd.} % Organization

    {Sep. 2014 - Dec. 2014} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {
          Assisted with the implementation of a translator for translating LLVM IR to
          the intermediate representation used by IBM's XL C/C++/Fortran compiler.
        }
        \item {
          Expanded test coverage for IBM's LLVM IR translator by writing a program in
          C/C++ to spoof IBM's XL C/C++/Fortran compiler test drivers so that its test
          buckets could be reused for validating IBM's LLVM IR translator.

    {Operations Technology Developer (Intern)} % Job title
    {Citigroup Inc.} % Organization
    {Mississauga, ON, Canada} % Location
    {Sep. 2013 - Dec. 2013} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {
          Automated a bookkeeping workflow at Citigroup by writing a program in Java to
          periodically scrape financial data from an internal website using Selenium
          and format the data to Excel, which saved a bookkeeper over an hour per day
          otherwise spent doing manual data entry.
        }
        \item {
          Implemented automated tests for Citigroup's Global Stock Record
          (GSR) web frontend using Java and Selenium to reduce reliance on manual
          testing.
        }

    {System Software Developer (Intern)} % Job title
    {Nav Canada} % Organization

    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {
          Ported Nav Canada's air traffic control software build distribution tool from
          HP-UX to Red Hat Enterprise Linux with a Java ICEFaces web frontend, which
          simplified the air traffic control software build distribution workflow by
          automating steps that were previously performed manually.
