        \item {
          Optimized Storage Spaces Repair (i.e., RAID resilvering) by enhancing Storage
          Spaces metadata to track stale logical data copies at stripe granularity
          (i.e., 256 KiB) vs. extent granularity (i.e., 256 MiB) previously, which
          reduced the run time of Storage Spaces Repair from hours to minutes.
        }
        \item {
          Implemented Storage Spaces support for configuring, deploying, and managing
          Storage Spaces with node-mirrored mirror and node-mirrored parity multilevel
          resiliency settings on 2-node Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) Failover Clusters,
          which enabled Storage Spaces on 2-node S2D Failover Clusters to tolerate 1
          node + 1 drive failures vs. 1 node failure previously.
        }
        \item {
          Designed and implemented an extra-resilient cache for staging writes to
          Storage Space ranges backed by a suboptimal number of logical copies to
          enable write forward progress without compromising on redundancy and risking
          data loss.

          Assisted with the implementation of a translator for translating LLVM IR to
          the intermediate representation used by IBM's XL C/C++/Fortran compiler.
        }
        \item {
          Expanded test coverage for IBM's LLVM IR translator by writing a program in
          C/C++ to spoof IBM's XL C/C++/Fortran compiler test drivers so that its test
          buckets could be reused for validating IBM's LLVM IR translator.

    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {
          Automated a bookkeeping workflow at Citigroup by writing a program in Java to
          periodically scrape financial data from an internal website using Selenium
          and format the data to Excel, which saved a bookkeeper over an hour per day
          otherwise spent doing manual data entry.
        }
        \item {
          Implemented automated tests for Citigroup's Global Stock Record
          (GSR) web frontend using Java and Selenium to reduce reliance on manual
          testing.

        \item {
          Ported Nav Canada's air traffic control software build distribution tool from
          HP-UX to Red Hat Enterprise Linux with a Java ICEFaces web frontend, which
          simplified the air traffic control software build distribution workflow by
          automating steps that were previously performed manually.
